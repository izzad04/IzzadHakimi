    <h1 id="organization">Organization That I Joined at UiTM</h1>

    <p>
        I joined an organization called <span class="highlight">Jawatankuasa Perwakilan Kolej (JPK)</span> during my studies at UiTM Negeri Sembilan Branch, Rembau Campus. I became a member starting from my first semester until my fifth and final semester at UiTM. Initially, I held the position of <span class="highlight">Exco Aduan & Kebajikan</span> throughout my time in JPK, but recently, I was reassigned to the <span class="highlight">Exco Publisiti & Multimedia</span> portfolio. I gained a wealth of experiences while participating in this organization.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let me share about JPK. JPK is an organization responsible for managing the residential colleges within UiTM. JPK taught me to always work as part of a team to ensure that tasks are completed efficiently. Additionally, when joining a club or organization, the most important aspect is communication. The President of <span class="highlight">Jawatankuasa Perwakilan Kolej</span>, Nor Azeera, once quoted a statement by Peter Drucker:
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        "The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said."
    </div>

    <p>
        This quote emphasizes the profound importance of communication within an organization. According to Peter Drucker, communication is not only about listening to the words being spoken but also about understanding the underlying messages, emotions, and intentions that may not be explicitly expressed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Furthermore, I was entrusted with the <span class="highlight">Exco Aduan & Kebajikan</span> portfolio for two years. 
        This role taught me how to communicate effectively with UiTM staff, such as those at the food court and cafeteria. 
        I learned how to compose announcements for periodic dissemination in the college WhatsApp groups. 
        Moreover, I had to accompany the <i>Resident College Staff (SRK)</i>  to the hospital if there were sick students after working hours, on Saturdays and Sundays, as well as during public holidays. This role required me to always be on standby in case of problems or emergencies.
    </p>

    
    <h1 id="challenges" align="right">Challenges I Faced as a Member of JPK</h1>
    <img src="image/picKonvensyen.jpg" height="230" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; border: 5px solid #0077c0;">
<p>
    One of the main challenges I encountered while being part of Jawatankuasa Perwakilan Kolej (JPK) was managing programs and liaising with higher authorities. 
    I took on the role of <span class="highlight">Program Director</span> for two programs which is:
    
    <ol>
        <li><em> Raya Glamz Outfit 1.0 </em></li>
        <li><em> Neon Zumba Night </em></li>
    </ol>
     
</p>
    
    Additionally, I served as the <span class="highlight">Assistant Program Director</span> for two programs which is:

    <ul>
        <img src="image/logoBullet.png" alt="Bullet" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; margin-right: 5px;"> <em>Kami Peduli 5.0</em>
        <br>
        <img src="image/logoBullet.png" alt="Bullet" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; margin-right: 5px;"> <em>Program Konvensyen JPK UiTM Cawangan Negeri Sembilan</em>
    </ul>

<p>
    Among all the programs I handled, the most challenging one was the <b><i> Program Konvensyen JPK UiTM Cawangan Negeri Sembilan</i></b>. 
    This program involved all the JPK committees from the Negeri Sembilan branch, with Rembau Campus hosting the event. 
    The preparation period for this program was less than two weeks, which required my team and me to work tirelessly to ensure its success. 
    The program spanned three days and two nights, from <i> 22 to 24 November 2024</i>.  
</p>
<P>
    There were numerous tasks to be managed, including inviting VIPs for the opening ceremony, such as <b>En Zulhilmi Bin Mohd Yunus (Timbalan Rektor HEP)</b>, along with other distinguished guests. Additionally, I was responsible for identifying and inviting suitable guest speakers for the allocated slots. Despite the limited preparation time, we overcame the challenges and successfully executed the program.  

    This experience was deeply meaningful for me as it allowed me to learn how to communicate effectively with external parties and gain a wealth of other valuable skills.

<h1 id="internship">Internship</h1>
    <img src="image/picIntern.jpg" height="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; border: 5px solid #0077c0;">
    <p>
        During the previous semester break, I underwent a two-month internship at the <span class="highlight">University of Malaya Medical Centre (PPUM)</span>, which is one of the subjects I needed to complete. I would like to share my experiences and tips from my time there.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first tip is to <span class="highlight">FOLLOW UP</span>. Don’t be lazy. Be proactive in dialing numbers or sending emails to companies. After that, make sure to follow up on the applications you have submitted. It’s always better to be prepared. If you’re lucky, you might receive a response within 3-4 days or 2-3 weeks, with the longest being about a month. In my case, I submitted only one application to PPUM, and they responded very quickly. Patience is key, and opportunities can come from anywhere. Most importantly, always follow up with the company.
    </p>

    <p>
        During my internship, my working hours were flexible. For example, if I started at 7:30 AM, I would finish at 4:30 PM. I was assigned to the <span class="highlight">Patient Information Department</span> for the entire two months. This department comprises several sections, including the Medical Reports Section, Records Management, Statistics and Notifications, and finally, the Administration Section. I had to rotate through all these sections during my internship.
    </p>

    <p>
        First, I worked in the <span class="highlight">Records Management Section</span>, where I learned about binding (the process of binding patient care files/notes) and the loan counter, which involved handling security files, receiving CS files, scanning patient records, mapping processes, file disposal, and much more. In this section, I gained a lot of knowledge, such as how to perform proper binding and what actions to take when documents are damaged.
