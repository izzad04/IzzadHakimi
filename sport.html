        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p>
            Taekwondo holds a significant presence in Malaysia as one of the most popular martial arts and sports. 
            It was introduced to the country in the 1960s and has since grown into a widely practiced discipline, embraced by people of all ages. 
            Governed by organizations such as the <b>Taekwondo Malaysia (TM)</b>, which is recognized by the <b>World Taekwondo (WT)</b>, the sport has a structured framework for training, competitions, and development.
            Malaysian Taekwondo athletes have consistently achieved success at regional and international levels, including the <i>Asian (SEA) Games, Asian Games, and World Taekwondo Championships.</i> 
            The sport is actively promoted in schools, universities, and community centers, contributing to its widespread adoption as both a competitive sport and a method of personal development.

        <!-- Personal Experience -->
        <p>
            I have been involved in Taekwondo since I was seven years old in 2011 and continue to practice the sport to this day. 
            Throughout my journey in Taekwondo, I have experienced both challenges and triumphs that have shaped my growth. 
            I have participated in numerous competitions, primarily in sparring events, competing at various levels, including international, national, state, and school tournaments. 
            Most recently, I proudly represented UiTM Cawangan Negeri Sembilan at the Super UiTM competition held at UiTM Shah Alam. 
            Despite setbacks like a finger fracture during a competition, Taekwondo has taught me valuable life skills, including time management, punctuality, discipline, and self-defense.
