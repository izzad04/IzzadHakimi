    Taekwondo holds a significant presence in Malaysia as one of the most popular martial arts and sports. 
    It was introduced to the country in the 1960s and has since grown into a widely practiced discipline, embraced by people of all ages. 
    Governed by organizations such as the <b>Taekwondo Malaysia (TM)</b>, which is recognized by the <b>World Taekwondo (WT)</b>, the sport has a structured framework for training, competitions, and development.
    Malaysian Taekwondo athletes have consistently achieved success at regional and international levels, including the <i>Asian (SEA) Games, Asian Games, and World Taekwondo Championships.</i> 
    The sport is actively promoted in schools, universities, and community centers, contributing to its widespread adoption as both a competitive sport and a method of personal development.
    Taekwondo in Malaysia is celebrated not only for its physical benefits, such as improving strength, flexibility, and coordination, but also for instilling values like discipline, respect, and perseverance. 
    Its emphasis on mental focus and character-building has made it particularly popular among the youth. 
    Furthermore, Malaysia hosts regular tournaments and championships, providing a platform for young talents to showcase their skills and progress in the global Taekwondo arena.

        I have been involved in Taekwondo since I was seven years old in 2011 and continue to practice the sport to this day. 
        Throughout my journey in Taekwondo, I have experienced both challenges and triumphs that have shaped my growth. 
        I have participated in numerous competitions, primarily in sparring events, competing at various levels, including international, national, state, and school tournaments. 
        Most recently, I proudly represented UiTM Cawangan Negeri Sembilan at the Super UiTM competition held at UiTM Shah Alam, where participants from all UiTM branches competed.  
        Taekwondo is not just about the use of kicks but also incorporates hand techniques. 
        The sport is structured with a progression of ranks, starting from the white belt to the prestigious black belt. 
        During my years of practice, I encountered a significant challenge when I fractured my finger after being kicked by an opponent during a competition. 
        Despite such setbacks, I gained valuable life skills, such as effective time management, as the sport emphasizes punctuality and discipline. 
        Additionally, Taekwondo has taught me the art of self-defense, equipping me with the confidence and techniques to handle potential challenges in the future.
